# Aevum Edge Sentinel
 
**A privacy-first wearable that senses at the edge, reasons in the cloud with a Qwen agent, and acts locally — without ever making a diagnosis.**

Aevum Edge Sentinel is a screenless, wrist-worn wellbeing-sensing node. Cheap, no-solder sensors read your body and your surroundings; the device extracts features **on-device**, and a **Qwen agent** running on Alibaba Cloud interprets them against *your own baseline* to return a gentle, explainable wellbeing nudge. Raw sensor data never leaves the wrist, consent is enforced fail-closed, and the system keeps working — with a simpler local rule — when the network drops.
 
It deliberately **never diagnoses**. It tells you whether your signals are **steady**, worth a **watch**, or **elevated** versus your baseline, explains why in plain language, and — if something is persistently off — signposts you to a real professional. It never names or infers a condition, and never tries to treat one you've declared.

## Why it fits EdgeAgent
 
| Track requirement                | How Aevum Edge Sentinel does it                                                                                                        |

| **Perceive** via edge sensors    | PPG (heart rate), motion (accelerometer/gyro), skin-contact temperature and ambient temp/humidity over one I²C bus                     |
| **Reason** via cloud APIs        | A **Qwen `qwen3.7-plus` agent** on Alibaba Cloud plans, calls specialised tools, grounds itself with retrieval, remembers your baseline, and synthesises a structured wellbeing flag |
| **Act** locally                  | The device surfaces the flag and nudge; an on-device rule keeps acting when offline                                                    |
| **Privacy-aware data handling**  | Only **derived features** leave the device; **fail-closed consent gate**; stateless backend; no identity logged                       |
| **Graceful offline degradation** | If Wi-Fi or the cloud is unavailable, the device falls back to a transparent local threshold rule and never goes dark                  |

## The Sentinel Agent — not a single call
 
The cloud core is a real **agent**, not one LLM request. A Qwen orchestrator runs a **plan → act → synthesise** loop (ReAct-style): it decides which specialised tools to call, chains them, grounds itself in retrieval, remembers your baseline, asks a clarifying question when it is genuinely unsure, and is bounded by a diagnosis-free safety layer. **Every tool call is logged — the trace is the evidence that it reasons, rather than merely responds.**

   compute_cardiac_features · analyse_movement · thermal_context
   compare_to_baseline · retrieve_wellbeing_context (RAG) · safety_signpost
```
 
- **`compute_cardiac_features`** — heart rate + pulse-rate variability, **gated on stillness** (PPG variability is motion-sensitive, so it is only trusted when the device reports you were still).
- **`analyse_movement`** — two-stage: recognise the activity (rest / walk / active), *then* describe movement quality (cadence, regularity, steadiness) and any fall flag.
- **`thermal_context`** — skin-contact versus ambient temperature difference.
- **`compare_to_baseline`** — z-scores versus *your own* rolling baseline — the memory pattern that makes "vs your baseline" rigorous rather than rhetorical.
- **`retrieve_wellbeing_context`** — retrieval over a licence-clean wellbeing knowledge base, so advice is grounded, not invented.
- **`safety_signpost`** — decides whether to prompt you to see a professional (escalation, never a diagnosis).
Two governing guards wrap the loop: **fail-closed consent** (no valid token, no processing) and a **diagnosis-free scrubber** that neutralises any output drifting toward naming or inferring a condition.
 
**Measured, not asserted** (run `backend/prove/metrics.py`):
 
- **~33× data minimisation** — a raw PPG + motion window is ~8 KB; the derived payload that actually leaves the wrist is ~240 bytes.
- **Sub-millisecond offline fallback** — the on-device rule returns instantly with no network and no model.
- **Personalisation** — the *same* readings produce *different* flags against two different baselines (e.g. HR 82 / HRV 30 reads **steady** for an athlete, **elevated** for a calm baseline).

```
 
The reasoning runs on the **hosted Qwen Cloud API** on Alibaba Cloud — the base URL is visible in [`backend/agent/client.py`](backend/agent/client.py). Deployment is on **Alibaba Cloud ECS**; see [`backend/DEPLOY.md`](backend/DEPLOY.md).

## The companion app
 
The wearable is screenless; a companion phone app handles personalisation and the human-readable side.
 
**Onboarding & profile** (one-time, editable) — height, weight, age range; activity frequency, type and intensity; diet type, patterns and hydration; any physical or mental health context you *choose* to share (per-category consent); and your goals (move more, sleep, stress, routine, understanding your own signals). This builds your **personal baseline + context**, so interpretations are tuned to *you* rather than to an average.
 
**What the app shows** — your flag (steady / watch / elevated vs baseline); a plain-language explanation that cites your own numbers; general recommendations across food, movement and rest; your daily step count; a signpost to *"consider seeing a professional if this continues or you feel unwell"*; and optional product links with a clear affiliate disclosure. It never names or infers a condition, and never treats a declared one.

## Hardware (no-solder, ~£45–49)
 
XIAO ESP32-S3 + Seeed expansion board · MAX30102 (PPG) · MPU-6050 (motion) · BME280 (ambient temp/humidity) · LiPo · mesh wristband. All sensors share one **3.3 V** I²C bus at distinct addresses: `0x57`, `0x68`, `0x76`. An optional TMP117 (`0x48`) adds **research-grade** skin temperature with zero firmware rework — the address slot is already reserved.
 
The whole build is deliberately solder-free: a small breadboard and jumper wires only, so it is accessible to makers who can't (or shouldn't) solder.
 
---
 
## Quick start
 
**1. Backend (Alibaba Cloud)** — see [`backend/DEPLOY.md`](backend/DEPLOY.md). In short: deploy `app.py` on an **Alibaba Cloud ECS instance** (or Simple Application Server / Function Compute), set `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY` and `CONSENT_SECRET`, run it, and open the port. Visiting `/` returns a health JSON — **this URL is your proof of Alibaba Cloud deployment.** The hosted Qwen Cloud base URL is visible in [`backend/agent/client.py`](backend/agent/client.py).
 
**2. Firmware** — open `firmware/edge_sentinel.ino` in the Arduino IDE (board: `XIAO_ESP32S3`). Install the libraries listed in the sketch header, set your Wi-Fi and the backend URL, and flash.
 
**3. Run** — the device samples every ~15 s and prints the flag, nudge and explanation to the Serial Monitor. Pull the network and watch it fall back to the local rule. To prove the whole agent **with no hardware**: `FORCE_MOCK=1 python backend/prove/simulate.py` and `FORCE_MOCK=1 python backend/prove/metrics.py`.

## Privacy & safety
 
- **Data minimisation** — only derived features (a handful of numbers) are sent; raw PPG and motion waveforms never leave the device.
- **Consent, fail-closed** — the backend refuses to interpret anything without a valid consent token; withdraw consent and processing stops. Health and mental-health context is special-category data, captured per-category, stored on-device, and deletable.
- **Diagnosis-free by construction** — the model is constrained to a wellbeing vocabulary, and a server-side scrubber strips any output that drifts toward a medical claim.
- **Not a medical device** — output is general wellbeing context only, never a diagnosis or treatment. If you feel unwell, speak to a healthcare professional.

## About
 
Built by **Aevum Foundry AI Ltd**, a UK AI-tools company. The first real-world pilot is planned for **Terra**, a rural cooperative wellness community in the Algarve, Portugal — a setting where privacy matters and reliable connectivity can't be assumed, which is exactly what an edge-first design is for.
